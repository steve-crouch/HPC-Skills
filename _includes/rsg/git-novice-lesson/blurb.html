  Automated Version Control is a process for tracking changes to files and folders within a 'repository'.
  This workshop will teach you how to use the Git version control system to manage your code, tracking changes to files,
  inspecting and merging multiple different changes, and how to collaborate with other Git users using the GitHub online
  respository store.
