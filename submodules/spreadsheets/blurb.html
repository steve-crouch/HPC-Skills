  Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. Most
  researchers have data in spreadsheets, so it is the place that many research
  projects start.

  We often organise data in spreadsheets in the ways that we as humans want to work with data. However, in order
  to use tools that make computation and data analysis more efficient, reusable and reproducible, such as programming
  languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data in a particular way so that computers can "understand" and
  "make use of" the data. Since this is where most research projects start,
  this is where we want to start too!
